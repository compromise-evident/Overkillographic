Overkillographic log



Version 1.1.0   Accepts files of any name length - major bug fix. path_to_file[]
                was not being  terminated with null for each new file name load.
                Removed pauses of 2 seconds option (user knobs.)

Version 1.0.0   Good for modifying mass-do on other files, starting EXIF killing
                and barcode/QR code creation once you get the writes as blocks.
